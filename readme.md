Above I listed the links I used to add to my knowledge of web development and HTML/CSS understanding.
I used most of the earlier days of this delivery to read up on different things as I weren't in class.

## E.g. 
I used innerHTML to overwrite and throw out old data in the localStorage, it's clean, simple and effective.

I opted for using dynamic rendering for each of the new games, I found this to be most effective and 
adding this to the mjs file as per the assignment at first felt really type heavy, but it ends up dynamically
rendering all written text into the html website with the use of one function, resulting it to be reuseable and clean.

I used previousElementSibling as that allowed me to directly manipulate the DOM elements, again resulting in a dynamic feature.

I tried to create the edit button, but fell a bit short on time and crashed my pc.
